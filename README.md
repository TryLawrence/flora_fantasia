# flora_fantasia

This project is an assignment from The Odin Project, as a way for learners to test their skills by creating and styling a website from scratch using all that they've learned. 

This website is about flowers in my current workplace (completely fictional, I don't work in a flowershop nor have I ever worked at one) and the various types that you can access.
